## Project Description

PopcornPicks is a user-friendly movie recommender that curates a tailored list of 10 movie predictions based on user-provided movie preferences. Users can input their favorite movies, and our algorithm refines recommendations based on feedback‚ÄîLiked, Disliked, or Yet To Watch. Additionally, users can write reviews, save them, check out the latest movies out there and also check out the buzz going on about movies by viewing what others are writing for their reviews.

## Getting Started

Step 1:
Git Clone the Repository

    git clone https://github.com/tanmaypardeshi/PopcornPicks.git

(OR) Download the .zip file on your local machine from the following link

    https://github.com/tanmaypardeshi/PopcornPicks

Step 2:
Follow the setup instructions in the wiki documentation

    https://github.com/tanmaypardeshi/PopcornPicks/wiki/Installation-and-setup

<b>Finally, start enjoying personalized movie recommendations!</b>

### Render Deployment
This project is now hosted on the free web service [Render](https://render.com)! You can access the site at this URL:

[http://popcorn-picks.onrender.com](http://popcorn-picks.onrender.com)

*WARNING*: Since this is hosted on the free tier on render, it can be slow at times, use at your own discretion. 

#### Deploying to render
The deployment CI is set up such that any commits to the master branch will trigger a reploy of the project. This generally takes around 2-3 minutes, so if you try and access the site right after committing and receive a 502, it is most likely that the deploy has not finished yet

### Lists Feature
![Lists](./asset/ListsFeature.gif)

We have added a new 'Lists' feature. The users can create a list of (at least) five movies they would like to recommend to other users. The users can view the lists of other users on the 'Lists' page. It creates a sense of community. They are recommendations from other human users and not a computer.

### Filtering options
![Filtering](./asset/Filtering.gif)

We have added two filtering options for users: Genres and Release Year. Users can now personalize their recommendations by limiting them to a particular genre or a movie released in a specific year. 

### Recommendation Logic
![Review](./asset/Review.gif)

We have made changes to the recommendation system. Users can review the movies they are recommended to watch, and their reviews are now included as feedback to our recommendation code logic. The users can now add scores with their reviews instead of just text. The training data includes these past reviews with the scores from the user in addition to the five movies they select. This makes the recommendations better suited to the tastes of the user. Release year and genres selected by the user are also considered when selecting the top nine recommendations.

### UI Changes
![UI](./asset/UIChanges.gif)

Each movie in the database now has its own webpage where the users can read up on the movie and also view reviews from other users. This helps them make more informed decisions. This also cleans up the UI and makes for a much better experience. The users can explore and learn new information instead of being bombarded with it. 

## Future Scope

PopcornPicks is a dynamic project with endless possibilities for expansion and enhancement. Here are some exciting avenues for future development:

1. **Enahncements on the User Profile**: Implement more advanced features to the user profile. For example, include edit
or delete review option. Make validations for the duplicate reviews. These are a few examples of what can be enhanced in 
the future

2. **Integration with Streaming Services**: Integrate with popular streaming services to provide real-time availability information and seamless access to recommended movies.

3. **Dynamic Chat Rooms**: The current design of the application supports only a single chat room which is global to the website. The chat rooms can be made dynamic to a movie.

4. **Improved Recommendation Algorithm**: Enhance the recommendation engine with more advanced machine learning models and collaborative filtering techniques to provide even more accurate and personalized movie suggestions.

5. **Interactive Review System**: In this feature, users should be able to comment on other people's reviews so that the site can be more interactive and engaging for everyone

6. **Page for TV Shows**: Add a seperate section for TV shows. This can include shows from all streaming websites and television. This can be a parallel to the movies section of the website.

7. **Email Notifier**: Allow the user to send their favourite movie recommendations via email.

8. **Wishlist Feature**: Implement a feature where users can wishlist the recommendations they like and make lists of movies based on their preferences.

The future of PopcornPicks is full of potential, and we invite developers, movie lovers, and anyone passionate about cinema to join us in making this platform the ultimate movie companion.
